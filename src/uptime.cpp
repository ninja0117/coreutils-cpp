     Usage:
       uptime [options] [FILE]

       Print the current time, the length of time the system has been up,
         the number of users on the system, and the average number of jobs
         in the run queue over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes. Processes in
         an uninterruptible sleep state also contribute to the load average.

     Options:
       -h --help              Show this screen
       --version              Show version
